# Smart Study Buddy

Smart Study Buddy is a web-based study support system developed as part of an MSc Computing & Information Systems final year project at the University of Greenwich. The system transforms static academic materials into interactive study tools to improve learning efficiency and engagement.

## Problem
Students often study from static resources such as PDFs and scanned notes, which do not effectively support active learning, revision, or knowledge retention.

## Solution
The system processes uploaded academic content and automatically generates interactive learning resources including quizzes, flashcards, summaries, concept maps, and a study planner with gamified progress tracking.

## Key Features
- PDF and image-based document processing
- Automatic quiz and flashcard generation
- Rule-based content summarisation
- Concept map visualisation
- Study planner with PDF export
- Gamification using XP and levels
- Secure user authentication and progress tracking

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Backend: Node.js  
- Database: MongoDB  
- Authentication: Firebase  
- Tools: PDF.js, Tesseract.js (OCR), D3.js

## Methodology
The project was developed using an Agile methodology with iterative sprints, enabling continuous feature refinement, testing, and integration throughout the development lifecycle.

## Algorithms 
- **Content Extraction:** Text extraction from PDFs and OCR for image-based documents  
- **Regex-Based Search:** Pattern matching used to clean, structure, and identify key academic content  
- **Quiz Generation:** Rule-based question and distractor creation  
- **Flashcards:** Automatic term–definition extraction  
- **Gamification Logic:** XP-based progress and level unlocking

All algorithms are deterministic and rule-based to ensure transparency and explainability.

## Academic Context
This project represents an academic prototype demonstrating full-stack web development and rule-based intelligent systems.
